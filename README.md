# React ToDo

This is the result of me learning how to use React with Recoil and TypeScript. My goal was to create a responsive ToDo app with state using React. The Recoil [basic tutorial](https://recoiljs.org/docs/basic-tutorial/intro) served as a base. My secondary major goal was to learn how to use Flexbox and CSS animations. I achieved this by using Flexbox for the site layout and animating some of the app components. (and maybe involved going overboard with some, including the todo completion checkbox).

## Getting Started
